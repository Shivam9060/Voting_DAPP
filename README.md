# Voting_DAPP

## Overview

Voting_DAPP is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to participate in secure and transparent voting processes on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and immutability of voting data, making it resistant to fraud and manipulation. This project is built using React.js, Express.js, web3, Ganache, Solidity, Metamask, and Node.js.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Ensure you have Node.js installed to run the project.
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache): Install Ganache, a local blockchain for Ethereum development.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): Install the Metamask browser extension for interacting with Ethereum blockchain networks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Voting_DAPP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Voting_DAPP
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start Ganache:

   Run Ganache to simulate a local Ethereum blockchain.

5. Compile and deploy the smart contract:

   - Navigate to the "contracts" directory.
   - Use Truffle to compile and deploy the Solidity smart contract.

6. Start the Express.js server:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

7. Start the React.js front-end:

   ```bash
   npm run client
   ```

8. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Voting_DAPP.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity smart contract for the voting system.
- `client/`: Contains the React.js front-end code.
- `server.js`: Defines the Express.js server for handling Ethereum interactions.
- `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.
- `public/`: Contains the HTML template and static assets.
- `README.md`: The README file you are currently reading.

## Features
